# Morphological Operations in Computer Vision

This repository contains a **single Jupyter/Colab notebook** demonstrating the fundamental morphological operations in image processing.  
It is designed for students learning **Fundamentals of Computer Vision** and want to **see operations at the pixel level**.

---

## ðŸ“š Covered Operations
- **Erosion** â€“ shrinks objects by removing boundary pixels.
- **Dilation** â€“ expands objects by adding boundary pixels.
- **Opening (Erosion â†’ Dilation)** â€“ removes small noise while preserving larger structures.
- **Closing (Dilation â†’ Erosion)** â€“ fills small holes and gaps.
- **Boundary Extraction** â€“ extracts the edges of objects.
- **Region Filling** â€“ fills holes inside binary objects.
